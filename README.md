Response: { token, user }

POST /auth/login
Body: { email, password }
Response: { token, user }
```

## 🧪 Testing Routes

### Public Routes (No auth required)

- `/` - Home page
- `/login` - Login (redirects to /quizzes if already logged in)
- `/register` - Register (redirects to /quizzes if already logged in)
- `*` - 404 Not Found

### Protected Routes (Auth required)

- `/quizzes` - Browse all quizzes
- `/quiz/:id` - Take a quiz
- `/result/:attemptId` - View quiz results
- `/attempts` - View attempt history

### Test Workflow

1. **Open browser**: http://localhost:5173
2. **Register**: Create new account
3. **Login**: Login with your account
4. **Browse**: View available quizzes
5. **Take Quiz**: Answer all questions and submit
6. **View Result**: See your score and review answers
7. **History**: View all your attempts
8. **Logout**: Logout and verify redirect to login

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Registration

```
User fills form → POST /auth/register → Token received → Redirect to /login
```

### Login

```
User enters credentials → POST /auth/login → Token stored in localStorage 
→ JWT added to axios headers → Redirect to /quizzes
```

### Protected Routes

```
User accesses /quizzes → Check AuthContext.isAuthenticated 
→ True: Show page | False: Redirect to /login
```

### Logout

```
User clicks logout → Remove token from localStorage → Update AuthContext 
→ Clear axios Authorization header → Redirect to /login
```

### Unauthorized Response

```
Protected API call returns 401 → Remove token → Redirect to /login
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Frontend not loading

```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :5173

# Kill process on that port
kill -9 <PID>

# Restart
npm run dev
```

### Backend API not responding

```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:8080/quiz

# Check service logs for errors
# In backend terminal, look for exception messages
```

### JWT token issues

```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.getItem('token')     // Should return JWT
localStorage.clear()               // Clear auth data
location.reload()                  // Refresh page
```

### CORS errors

- Ensure backend has CORS configuration
- Check browser console for specific errors
- Verify backend URL in axiosInstance

### Quiz not loading

- Verify quiz data exists in backend database
- Check network tab in DevTools for failed requests
- Look at backend logs for database errors

## 📝 Notes

- Passwords should be hashed on backend (never store plaintext)
- JWT tokens should have expiration time
- Implement refresh token mechanism for production
- Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints
- Validate all inputs on both frontend and backend
- Use HTTPS in production (not HTTP)
- Store sensitive data in environment variables
